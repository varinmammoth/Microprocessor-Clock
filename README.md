# Oscilloscope Clock controlled by PIC18 Microprocessor
This is the source code to our Oscilloscope Clock project. The program ouputs signals from a PIC18 microprocessor into an oscilloscope in XY-mode. A functioning analogue clock is displayed on the oscilloscope. The other functionalities include setting the time, setting an alarm time, turning the alarm on or off, and cycling through clockfaces using a keypad. There is also an external LCD display which gives information about the status of the alarm: whether it is on or off, and what time it is set to.
